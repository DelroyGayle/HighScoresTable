# High Score Tables

## Challenge Overview
1. Make a React app which lists some high score tables.
2. Each country must have its own High Score table displayed.
3. You must make AT LEAST:
* HighScoreTable - a table with a country name and a list of player-scores for that country.
* PlayerScore - component responsible for displaying a single score by one player 
4. Present the High Score Tables sorted alphabetically by country name
5. Within each individual table, show the highest scores first - i.e. sort the scores numerically, descending.
6. Add a single button at the top of the page which toggles the sort order of every high-score-table between ascending and descending by scores.
7. Add a "world-wide" table, shown first, which shows the sorted high scores from EVERYONE, regardless of country.
